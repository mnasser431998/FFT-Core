# Overview
This is a c model for R2SDF (radix-2 single delay feedback) FFT architecture. It is the most efficient impelentation of the FFT which enables high throughput and low resource implementation for FFT in hardware. 


# File Structure
we have mainly 3 files: -
1. `main.c`; sdf c code + testbench
2. `fft_support.h`; functions that help coding for FFTs
3. `running.sh`; script that complies the code

# how to run it?

simply via cmd hit:

```shell
user$ source running.sh

```
